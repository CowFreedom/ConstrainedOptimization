This package is under active development. This manual was created in February 2021 for version number 0.\+34.\hypertarget{index_System}{}\doxysubsection{Requirements}\label{index_System}
In its current form, the package has been shown to work on Windows 10, Linux Ubuntu and mac\+OS Mojave 10.\+14.\+4. On Windows 10, two compilers were tested, GCC 9.\+3.\+0 and Visual Studio v16.\+3.\+10. It is assumed that the package also works for older compiler versions that support C++17 features. On Linux Ubuntu only GCC was tested. If GCC is used, UG4 might have to be rebuilt with the -\/pthread flag. Using Clang might necessitates adding the -\/std=c++11 flag to the build process. For a list of bugs and recommended features see the page issues.
