\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file defines the abstract base class Evaluation, which is used by nearly every optimizer like \mbox{\hyperlink{newton_8h}{newton.\+h}}. Classes inheriting from Evaluation define how data is loaded and the target function to be optimized is evaluated. Evaluation subclasses cannot always be reused. Sometimes every optimization problem requires its own Evaluation subclass. Prominent example is Biogas\+Evaluation, which has been tailored for the UG4 biogas\+\_\+app problem, but can also be used for problems that behave \char`\"{}similar\char`\"{} (in the sense of data loading, interpolation and evaluation). As evaluation subclasses are not only dependent on the numeric type but also the computation mode Config\+Computation, sometimes several evaluation subclasses are created for the same problem. \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See also}
