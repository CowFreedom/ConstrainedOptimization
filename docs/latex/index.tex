This package is under active development. This manual was created in March 2020 for version number 0.\+31.\hypertarget{index_System}{}\doxysubsection{Requirements}\label{index_System}
Due to the usage of OS specific functions for process generation, the plugin is not necessarily multiplatform. In its current form, the package has been shown to work on Windows 10. Two compilers were tested, G\+CC 9.\+2.\+0 and Visual Studio v16.\+3.\+10. It is assumed that the package also works for older compiler versions. Small experiments in Linux Fedora have also been conducted. The results were encouraging but Linux is officially not yet supported. For a list of bugs and recommended features see the page issues.
