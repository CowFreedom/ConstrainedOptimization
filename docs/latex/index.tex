This package is under active development. This manual was created in June 2020 for version number 0.\+32.\hypertarget{index_System}{}\doxysubsection{Requirements}\label{index_System}
Due to the usage of OS specific functions for process generation, the plugin is not necessarily multiplatform. In its current form, the package has been shown to work on Windows 10 and Linux Ubunto. On the former, two compilers were tested, G\+CC 9.\+2.\+0 and Visual Studio v16.\+3.\+10. It is assumed that the package also works for older compiler versions. On the latter, only G\+CC was tested. If G\+CC is used, U\+G4 might have to be recompiled with the -\/pthread flag For a list of bugs and recommended features see the page issues.
